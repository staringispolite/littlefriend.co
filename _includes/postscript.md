#### P.S. WE WORK WITH CHARITIES THAT HAVE TANGIBLE RESULTS OUR GUESTS CAN SEE IN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES

By 2014, Ragemas had reached $7,500 in charitable giving to a number of partner charities, such as the Cancer Research Institute, and local charities in San Francisco. Driving awareness and subsequent giving from San Franciscoâ€™s smartest and most diverse crowd has been one of our most important goals. This year, our event will support the following charities:

Pattern.org enables cancer patients to direct their tumor tissue to researchers working on building cancer models. We hope to raise enough money to create and sustain 2 tumor models.

Planned Parenthood (SF Chapter) has transformed women's health and empowered millions of people worldwide to make informed health decisions, forever changing the way they live, love, learn and work.

SF Parks and Recreation Department provides nearly 800,000 San Franciscans with essential opportunities to maintain healthy, active lifestyles.
